# US-Education-Enrollment-Status
## Final group project for W200 Introduction to Data Science Programming (Spring 2021)

## Scope:  
To demonstrate basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques using numpy and pandas

## Research Questions:   
1. Are there any conspicuous trends in total enrollment?   
2. Are the enrollment trends the same for all the races?   
3. Looking at each individual race, are the enrollment trends the same at each education
level?   
4. Does a percentage increase or decrease in dropouts coincide with a percentage
increase or decrease in high school enrollment?   
5. Are there any historical events that may provide insight to the enrollment trends?   


## Dataset:  
We will use the publicly available data from the United States Census Bureau. “School Enrollment of the Population 3 Years Old and Over, by Level and Control of School, Race...: October 1955 to 2019”.
